# Public-Whitelist-Bot

This is an open-sourced old version of the server control bot running on sudakia's server.

discord.gg/dyKq569

The bot runs off of Discordia in the Lua programming language. The main script (and the one run during startup) is whitelist.lua. Note that it's probably a hot mess, I made the bot as a funny thing and did not plan ahead, so it's quite crowded.

This repo no longer reflects the current state of the bot, but rather an older version of it. This is for the reason that the inner-workings of the bot give way to easier bypasses and a way see hidden features.


THIS REPO IS NOT THE FULL WORKING DIRECTORY

I've only included the scripts created by me and the Discordia dependency. References in the script to outside sources should be assumed to be present.
