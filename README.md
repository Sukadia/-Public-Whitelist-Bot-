# Public-Whitelist-Bot

This is a public version of the Whitelist/Blacklist bot running on Sudakia's server.

discord.gg/dyKq569

The bot runs off of Discordia in the Lua programming language. The main script (and the one run during startup) is whitelist.lua. Note that it's probably a hot mess, I made the bot as a funny thing and did not plan ahead, so it's quite crowded. Also the bot token is an old one.

Feel free to make any push requests, I'd gladly look over them and add them to the bot if it works out. For actual new features it might be a good idea to consult me first before going into the work.


THIS REPO DOES NOT INCLUDE:

Luvit runtime environment, "savedata" file

However, these are in the actual folder.
