# Nothing In Particular
#### A bot for [Sudakia's Server](https://discord.gg/sunJvMs)

This is a bot run with the Discordia library that ultimately controls the entire server. For context on its functions, refer to the #help channel in the discord.

### Changes

This repo is updated periodically. If you plan to contribute to the code, it's a good idea to contact me first so we can make sure you're editing something that's up-to-date. 

### Context

The bot runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B using the Raspberry Pi OS. [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) is the process manager that keeps the bot running.

**This repo is not the full working directory.**
I've only included the scripts created by me and the Discordia dependency. References in the script to outside sources should be assumed to be present.

### Dependencies

[Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia), Discord API library

[Luvit](https://luvit.io), Lua Runtime Environment
