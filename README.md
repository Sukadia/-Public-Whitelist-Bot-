# Public-Whitelist-Bot

This is a public version of the server control bot running on sudakia's server.

discord.gg/dyKq569

The bot runs off of Discordia in the Lua programming language. The main script (and the one run during startup) is whitelist.lua. Note that it's probably a hot mess, I made the bot as a funny thing and did not plan ahead, so it's quite crowded.

If for some reason you'd like to create a pull request (free labor !!!), I'll look it over and it'd be best to include a detailed description on what it changes. If it's good to go I'll add it to the main bot ~~and I'm not against collaborating with someone.~~

You can also post issues if you want, but it'd probably be best to DM me directly if there's need for one.


THIS REPO IS NOT THE FULL WORKING DIRECTORY

I've only included the scripts created by me and the Discordia dependency. References in the script to outside sources should be assumed to be present.
